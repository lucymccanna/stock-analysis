Module 2 - VBA 

## Overview of Project
VBA was used to automate the analysis of twelve different green energy stocks. The Total Daily Volumes and Annual Returns were calculated using conditionals and for loops, and color formatting was applied to enhance the visual appearance of the data.

## Results
In 2017, the annual return for 11 out of the 12 selected stocks was positive, with DQ having the highest performing stock at 199% return. The following year, only 2 of the 12 stocks had positive returns, ENPH and RUN (see Images 1 and 2).
